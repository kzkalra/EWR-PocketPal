PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

In order to empower women representatives elected at panchayat levels across the country, MWCD has initiated a massive training program across the country. The objective is to build their capacities around the issues related to village level management, basic knowledge of government schemes, social issues and their resolution, management of panchayat finances, village infrastructure etc. A training module has been developed for this, which is to be converted to an App version for interesting and interactive usage by Elected Women Representatives and trainers.
General problem statement:
i) At present Elected Women Representatives (EWR) don’t have the sources to know about the schemes of the government
ii) Women face a lot of social pressure or patriarchal pressure from the society and have no means to gather information
iii) Government conducts training workshop for EWR’s but are unable to train the women due to various issues listed above
iv) The training workshops are far away from the villages and women have no means of travelling to the destination
v) It’s hard to find proficient trainers that can conduct training in remote towns or village
vi) The lack of automation to provide support and train EWR’s can become a huge obstacle developing the status of women in society
vii) The need is to empower these EWR’s with an interactive app to help them get the information within seconds at the Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI)
viii) The basic premise of this exercise is the idea that informed and well trained EWR’s and leaders will be equipped to handle their roles and responsibilities independently and will be in a better position to participate effectively in panchayat affairs The users of this system are mainly one:
i) Women are the main users of this app, they need this app to help them get information about government schemes, social issues and their resolution, management of panchayat finances, village infrastructure etc.
ii) Government administration that want to disseminate knowledge to these EWR’s, so that they can be equipped to handle their roles and responsibilities independently and will be in a better position to participate effectively in panchayat affairs. Technology that can address this issue partially.
i) A Web Responsive app to educate women of the various schemes of the government, major social issues & their resolution, provide information on management of panchayat finances, village infrastructure etc.
ii) Sample data would be provided so that relevant information can be categorized and utilized to create the app.
iii) This app should be loosely coupled so that it can integrate with any system in operation to ingest data for various schemes
iv) The app should also support screen reader so that all EWR’s can click on the voice button and listen to the complete audio on the screen in an interactive manner
Desired Outcome:
i) A app which will help the EWR’s get the required information in the least amount of time
ii) The app will help all the EWR’s run their panchayats in an effective manner and take help from the latest schemes of the government to further improve the state of their village
